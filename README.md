# Mapping Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage that accesses from data from several different sources and diplays it clearly on a map. In this project we accessed data from an API and a GeoJSON. The API gives access to the basemaps, and the GeoJSON provides the earthquake data. 

## Results
Using the index.html provided in the Earthquakes Challenge folder, the user will see the image below when first loading the page.

In the top right hand corner of the webpage, the user is given several different filtering options. This includes 3 types or base maps (streets, satellite, and dark mode), and 3 data layers (All Earthquakes, Tectonic Plate Lines, and Major Earthquakes above 4.5 magnitude).

The image below shows the satellite imagery basemap.
